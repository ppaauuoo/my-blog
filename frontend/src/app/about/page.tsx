          <p>
            I'm a passionate programmer hailing from the vibrant tech scene of
            Thailand.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a diverse skill set spanning cutting-edge technologies and
            advanced algorithms, I bring a unique blend of expertise to every
            project.
            <p>
              My proficiency in genetic algorithms and linear optimization
              allows me to tackle complex problems with innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the web development front, I'm well-versed in modern frameworks
              like React and Next.js, enabling me to create dynamic and
              responsive user interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also experienced with powerful backend technologies such as
              Strapi, Django, and FastAPI, allowing me to build robust, scalable
              applications from front to back. Whether it's optimizing
              performance, crafting intuitive user experiences, or developing
              sophisticated algorithms, I'm always eager to push the boundaries
              of what's possible in software development.
